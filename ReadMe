Chrome Extension: Real-Time Audio Transcription
Project Overview
This project is a Chrome extension that captures audio from browser tabs and provides real-time transcription in a user-friendly sidepanel interface. The extension is designed to be a tool for capturing and transcribing audio from various sources, such as Google Meet or YouTube, with features like live transcription display, recording controls, and export functionality.





Core Features

Sidepanel Interface: The primary user interface is a sidepanel with controls to start and stop recordings, a live display of the transcription, a meeting timer, and status indicators.


Audio Capture System: The extension primarily focuses on capturing audio from the active browser tab. 

Bonus features include multi-source support, such as capturing audio from inactive tabs or optional microphone input, with channel labeling.


Transcription Integration: The extension processes audio in 30-second chunks. The recommended API for transcription is Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, which can be used for its free-tier availability and good accuracy.




Reliability & Performance: The extension includes error handling with automatic retry logic and graceful degradation. 


Bonus features include offline capabilities to buffer audio during connection loss and automatically sync when the connection is restored.

Technical Requirements

Browser Compatibility: The extension is primarily built for Google Chrome (latest version) and requires a minimum of Chrome 88+.


Architecture: The project uses Manifest V3, a service worker for background processing, and a sidepanel for the main user interface.


Permissions: The extension requires specific permissions to function correctly, including tabCapture, activeTab, sidePanel, and storage. Optional permissions like 

microphone and background are needed for bonus features.
